## PAGE 1 — Cover

**H1 — afterwave.fm**

**Tagline — Your music. Your page. We don't take a cut.**

*Optional short line:*
A place for your band. Your feed, your music, your gigs. Fans support you directly — we take zero per cent.

---

## PAGE 2 — Why we're doing this

**H2 — Why this exists**

In the old days, labels owned music and we bought CDs. Then piracy happened — and suddenly everyone was listening to everything. Music became abundant; access was no longer the gate.

Then Spotify came along and said: don't pay the labels, pay us; we'll work with the labels and share the money amongst us. Artists get almost nothing.

The music isn't the commodity anymore. Data is free. So let as many people listen as possible; if they want you to make more, they'll support you.

**No greedy labels. No greedy platforms.**

Afterwave is built on that idea: your page, your audience, your income. We charge a flat fee for the software. We don't take a cut of what you make.

---

## PAGE 3 — The problem / The alternative

**H2 — The way it is**

Big platforms and labels share the money. You get a fraction. Or you pay nothing up front but give up a cut of every sale, every tip, every subscription. Your audience is their audience. Your data is their data.

**H2 — The alternative**

**Your page.** One place for your band: bio, feed, music, gigs, photos. Your URL (e.g. yourband.afterwave.fm). Your branding. You own it.

**Your audience.** Fans follow you and get notified when you post. We don't hand over their emails; we send notifications on your behalf. You own the relationship.

**Your income.** Tips and fan subscriptions go 100% to you. We don't take a percentage. You pay us a flat monthly fee for the page — that's it. No surprise cuts, no revenue share.

**Free to listen.** All music is free to stream and download for everyone. No paywalled tracks. Fans support you because they want to, not because they're locked out.

## PAGE 4 — What you get (your page)

**H2 — What's on your page**

Everything you need in one place. No juggling five different tools.


| **Component**     | **What it does**                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Site builder**  | Shape your page: layout, sections, branding. Your handle, your name, your look.                                                                |
| **Content feed**  | Patreon-style feed: posts, images, YouTube embeds. All visible for free. Post when you want; fans get notified.                                |
| **Notifications** | “Be notified when I post.” Fans opt in. You see how many are subscribed; you trigger the notification. We send it — we don't give away emails. |
| **Music**         | Your catalog: tracks and albums. Free to listen and download for fans. You can rotate what's up (remove and add tracks within your tier).      |
| **Photo gallery** | Collections of photos. Link them to gigs. Fans can submit photos for you to approve.                                                           |
| **Gig calendar**  | Upcoming shows and tour dates. Fans who follow you see a combined calendar of everyone they follow.                                            |
| **Support**       | Tips (one-off) and recurring fan subscriptions. 100% to you. We don't take a cut.                                                              |
| **Merch**         | Link out to your store. You sell and fulfil; we don't take a cut.                                                                              |


Same features at every tier. We don't lock “basic” users out of feed, gallery, tips, or discovery. Tiering is by capacity (how many tracks, etc.), not by “can you do X.”

---

## PAGE 5 — Discovery

**H2 — How fans find you**

We're not a streaming farm. We're a discovery engine for independent scenes.

**Location** — Fans can search by country, region, or town. “Artists in Bristol,” “artists in Scotland,” “artists near me.” You set your location; they find you.

**Genre** — You pick from a list (e.g. Punk, Folk Punk, Indie rock). Fans browse and filter by genre. No paid boost, no algorithm pushing the same big names. Music rises through genuine discovery.

**Search** — Name, handle, bio. Full-text search so people can find you by name.

**Charts** — Download and listen charts (e.g. “most played this week”) based on real listener activity. No pay-to-place.

Discovery lives on the main site. Your page stays yours — we don't clutter it with “more artists like this” that send visitors away. Your page is your place; discovery is where new fans find you.

---

## PAGE 6 — Money (pricing, no cut)

**H2 — What you pay**

A flat monthly fee for your artist page. That's our only revenue from you. No percentage of tips, no percentage of fan subscriptions, no cut of merch.

**Tiers (by capacity)**


| **Tier**      | **Price** | **Track limit**  |
| ------------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| **Base**      | $10/month | 25 tracks        |
| **Growth**    | $20/month | 100 tracks       |
| **Unlimited** | $50/month | Unlimited tracks |


You can remove and add tracks freely (rotate your catalog). All tiers get the same core features: feed, gallery, gigs, notifications, tips, fan subs, discovery. Higher tiers = more capacity (and later, things like more photo storage or custom domain), not “unlocking” features.

**What fans pay you**

Tips and recurring fan subscriptions go **100% to you**. We don't take a cut. Payment processor fees (e.g. Stripe) are deducted from the fan's payment before it reaches you — we're upfront about that. No hidden platform cut.

**Billing** — Monthly, same date each month (e.g. you sign up on the 15th, you're charged on the 15th). Clear and predictable.

---

## PAGE 7 — Principles (short)

**H2 — What we believe**

- **Human-made music only.** This platform is for real musicians making real art.
- **Music is never paywalled.** All music is free to listen and download. Support is voluntary.
- **Artist sovereignty first.** You own your audience, your branding, your income.
- **No artificial promotion.** No paid boost, no algorithmic feed designed to addict. Discovery is by location, genre, and search — not by who paid.
- **Clear, flat pricing.** No hidden fees. No surprise bandwidth billing. No venture capital pressure that twists the product.

*Music is culture, not a commodity. The commodity is the software. We charge for the software; we don't take a cut of the culture.*

## PAGE 8 — Ethics: safety, moderation, AI, data

**H2 — How we run the place**

We want a platform that's safe, transparent, and respectful of your work and your fans. Here's how we handle safety, moderation, AI, and data.

**Safety and moderation**

We have a clear content policy and we take it seriously. **Human-made music only** — we don't host or promote AI-generated music. No illegal content, harassment, hate speech, or impersonation. No porn or sexual smut; mature themes in music and art are allowed when you mark them explicit — we then age-gate so under-18s can't access that content. We don't censor artistic expression; we label it.

**Reporting and review** — Fans and users can report content that breaks the rules. We review reports with a human team (we're small; we can't promise instant response, but we prioritise serious harm). If we remove something, we explain why and you can appeal. We don't hide behind bots: **moderation decisions are made by humans.** When we add comments or DMs, we design so minors aren't contacted by strangers — in line with what platforms are expected to do for child safety (e.g. UK Online Safety Act, COPPA).

**Copyright** — You must have the right to upload what you upload. We have a notice-and-takedown process for rights holders; we don't pre-vet every file. “Free to download” means fans don't pay — it doesn't mean anyone can upload without permission.

**AI**

We **do** use AI to help us build the platform (e.g. coding, documentation). We **don't** use AI to create what you see on the site — no AI-generated images, logos, or marketing copy; that's all human-made. We **don't** use your music, your fans' behaviour, or any platform data to train or feed AI systems. Your content is not training data.

If we ever use AI to help with moderation, it would only be to **flag** possible policy violations for **human review**. We would never auto-remove or auto-sanction based on AI alone — a human always decides. And we wouldn't use your data to train that AI.

**Data and privacy**

We **don't sell** your data or your fans' data. We **don't use** it for ad targeting or profiling. Free listeners may see light, privacy-respecting ads; Listener and Support subscribers are ad-free.

**Your content** — You own what you upload (music, posts, photos, bio). We host it; you can delete it or leave. We don't claim ownership of your work.

**Subscriber / notification data** — When fans opt in to “be notified when you post,” we (the platform) hold that data. We **don't give you** the list of emails or who signed up. You see **how many** are subscribed and you can **trigger** a notification — we send it on your behalf. That protects fan privacy and keeps the relationship clear: they signed up for notifications from us about you, not to have their email handed to you.

**Minimal use** — We use data only to run the product: auth, notifications, discovery, payments, support, and what the law requires (e.g. tax records). Not for anything else.

**Rights** — Where the law applies (e.g. UK GDPR, EU), we support access, correction, deletion, and data export. Fans can export their data and delete their account; you can export your content and remove your page. We document this properly in our privacy policy.

*We aim to be transparent and trusted by musicians. If you want the full policy wording, we'll have it on the site when we launch.*

## InDesign notes

- **Page breaks:** Split at each `--- PAGE N ---`. Page 1 = cover; 2 = why; 3 = problem/alternative; 4 = what you get; 5 = discovery; 6 = pricing; 7 = principles; 8 = ethics (safety, moderation, AI, data); 9 = CTA.
- **Headings:** H1 for cover title; H2 for section titles; body for paragraphs and list items.
- **Table:** Pages 4 and 6 use markdown tables; re-create as InDesign tables or styled lists.
- **CTA:** Replace *[URL or signup form]* with your actual waiting-list link (e.g. Typeform, Google Form, or landing page).
- **Optional:** Add a short “Who we are” or “Built by musicians” line on cover or back if you want; not included here.
