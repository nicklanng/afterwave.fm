# AI Use Policy

This policy defines how AI is used in the development and operation of Afterwave.fm.

## What we do not use AI for

- **No AI-created assets for the site.** All visual assets, copy, and creative content are made by humans. No AI-generated images, logos, illustrations, or marketing copy.
- **No use of platform data to train or feed AI.** We do not use artist uploads, listener behaviour, or any platform media as input to AI systems. Artist and listener data is not gathered for AI training or generation.

## What we use AI for

- **Development assistance only.** AI is used solely for what you see in this workflow: coding help, documentation, refactoring, and technical implementation. No AI in the product itself; no AI in the creation of product-facing assets or in the handling of user content.
- **Moderation first-pass (permitted, future).** We may use AI as a **“first pass”** to flag content that may violate our [moderation policy](./MODERATION.md) (e.g. likely policy violations, harmful content). In that case: (1) AI **flags** content for **human review**; we do **not** auto-remove or auto-sanction based on AI alone. (2) A human moderator decides whether to take action. (3) We document this use in this policy. If we add this, we will not use platform data to train or improve the AI; we use it only to assist moderators in triage.

## Summary

AI supports building the software and, if we add it, moderation triage (first-pass flagging for human review). It does not create the product’s face, and it does not consume the product’s content for training or generation. Moderation decisions are made by humans.
