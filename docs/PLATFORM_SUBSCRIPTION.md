# Platform (fan) subscription

Optional subscription for users to support the platform. Distinct from subscribing to an artist. We use Stripe (same as [Payments](./PAYMENTS.md)); we receive this revenue.

## Who and what

- **Who** — Any signed-in user can subscribe to support Afterwave.fm.
- **Revenue** — We receive this; it’s part of platform sustainability (with artist page subs).
- **Relationship to artist subs** — Separate product. A fan can support the platform and/or individual artists (recurring fan → artist is Patreon-style, via Stripe Connect; see [Payments](./PAYMENTS.md)).

## Supporter benefits

Subscribed users get **flair** and **features** that make the subscription feel worthwhile and that support the kind of community we want (zines, reviewers, photographers).

### Flair

- **Supporter badge** — Visible on their profile, comments, or wherever we show user identity. Signals “this person supports the platform.” We can add more flair options later (e.g. tiers, custom badges).

### Blog

- **User blog** on their account — Subscribers can publish a blog on their profile: reviews, links to artists they’re listening to, recommendations, essays. Good for **zines**, **independent reviewers**, and people who want to write about music on the platform. Posts can link to artist pages so discovery flows both ways (artist → fan and fan → artist).

### Personal gallery

- **Personal photo gallery** — Subscribers can have their own gallery of photos they want to share, with **links to artists** on the platform. This ties into the [artist photo gallery](./ARTIST_PAGES_PHOTO_GALLERY.md) flow: users submit photos to artists (artist approves for the artist’s gallery); the same user can also showcase photos in their **own** gallery and link to the artist. Great for **photographers** and people who document shows — they get a presence on the platform and drive traffic to artists.

## Open decisions

- Price(s) and billing interval (monthly, annual?).
- Single “supporter” tier vs multiple tiers (and whether higher tiers get more flair or blog/gallery features).
- Whether blog and gallery are supporter-only or available to all users (with supporter getting extra capacity/visibility).
